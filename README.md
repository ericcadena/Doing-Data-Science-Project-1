#Introduction
#Budweiser has requested that we present a report regarding the findings of this project. Through our recommendation, our client will regain their position as the King of Beers #and gain an advantage over competition!

#Files:
#CSV Files - The Beers dataset contains a list of 2410 US craft beers and Breweries dataset contains 558 US breweries. 
#PPT Presentation - Contains slides used in supplemental video presentations
#An RMarkdown file
#Knit HTML file
#Readme.md 

#Analysis Questions:

#1.	How many breweries are present in each state?
#  a.	Count 
#2.
#  a.	head
#3.	Address the missing values in each column.
#  a.	Create a bar chart to capture the amount  of NAs per column
#  b.	Imputation, take the mean SD. 
#4.	Compute the median alcohol content and international bitterness unit for each state. Plot a bar chart to compare.
#  a.	Bar chart of the median. 
#5.   Which state has the maximum alcoholic (ABV) beer? Which state has the most bitter (IBU) beer? 
#6.   Comment on the summary statistics and distribution of the ABV variable.
#7.   Is there an apparent relationship between the bitterness of the beer and its alcoholic content? Draw a scatter plot.  Make your best judgment of a relationship and EXPLAIN #your answer.
#8.  Budweiser would also like to investigate the difference with respect to IBU and ABV between IPAs (India Pale Ales) and other types of Ale (any beer with “Ale” in its name #other than IPA).  You decide to use KNN classification to investigate this relationship.  Provide statistical evidence one way or the other. You can of course assume your #audience is comfortable with percentages … KNN is very easy to understand conceptually.
#In addition, while you have decided to use KNN to investigate this relationship (KNN is required) you may also feel free to supplement your response to this question with any #other methods or techniques you have learned.  Creativity and alternative solutions are always encouraged.  
#9. Knock their socks off!  Find one other useful inference from the data that you feel Budweiser may be able to find value in.  You must convince them why it is important and #back up your conviction with appropriate statistical evidence. 


#Summary:
#Our analysis of the study results in marketing recommendations that can be provided to Budweiser Brewery using the relevant questions presented in the study. We recommend #tapping #into the New Mexico market with a new product that delivers high alcohol content and high bitterness. To accelerate sales and increase Budweisers' presence in upcoming #states, we #used a data-driven approach to implement these strategies. Video presentations accompany the write-up for this study.
